# Flat Engine
OpenGL game engine with editor.
Written in C++.

# To build
You may modify the Visual Studio project files and build it yourself or you can build it with CMake.
(Right now the engine is a static library and the editor is an app linked to it. The cmake file is for the old version which was just an exe with the editor.)
